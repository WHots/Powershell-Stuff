## Usage
For my fellow laptop users who don't use the laptop display, just externals.. and those moments when your computer goes to sleep and all the open windows went
to the laptop display, so now you have to dig it out from behind your desk (or where you pick to hide it) open the lid and manually drag & drop things to the external displays again.


Script just moves all open windows to your primary display & resizes them to be visible.

# Note
Windows already located on the primary display will still be effected by the resizing the script does.
