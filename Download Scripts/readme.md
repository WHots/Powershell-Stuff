Literally my first ever Powershell script, let alone using ps.

## About/Usage
> Right-Click - Run with powershell ... Look for folder on your desktop named "CoolStuff"

### How To Use

Inside of "file.txt" there are 2 examples of how to format the download list..
> [file download link]|[hardname]|[softname]

There should be NO spaces, each part should be divided by a | symbol.

### Terminology
* hardname = true file name.. "example.exe"
* softname = internal name / directory name "example" .. this can be anything.
